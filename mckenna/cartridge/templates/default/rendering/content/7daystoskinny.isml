						<h4>Tip of the Day | Eat Frequently: Breakfast, Snack, Lunch, Snack and Dinner. </h4>
						<p>Each day should start with a healthy breakfast, followed by a snack, lunch, another snack, 
							and then dinner. Try to space meals and snacks about 3 to 4 hours apart. Remember, 
							an effective ways to stimulate your metabolism is by eating right to maintain blood sugar levels. 
							You can enjoy higher and more consistent energy levels and help prevent your body from 
							going into "store mode."</p>

						<h4>Tip of the Day | Say No to Soda and Juices, Yes to Water, Water, Water! </h4>
						<p>Did you know that for every can of soda you drink, you're essentially drinking about 10 teaspoons of sugar? How's that for a reality check? Try to avoid liquid calories whenever 
							possible by opting to drink water instead of juice or soda. I recommend 8 to 10, 8 oz. glasses 
							of water per day, spaced evenly throughout the day. </p>

						<h4>Tip of the Day | Back Off on the Caffeine.</h4>
						<p>Caffeine is a diuretic and is known to cause dehydration. For those of you who feel run down
							or tired all the time, dehydration may be the cause. Keeping your body hydrated is important
							for your health and for shedding inches, so right now is the perfect time to start cutting back
							on caffeine. Try switching to decaffeinated or half-regular-half-decaf beverages to start. Plus,
							drink an extra glass of water for each cup of caffeinated coffee, tea, or cola that you consume.</p>

						<h4>Tip of the Day | Snack Smarter: Trade Sabotaging Snacks for Smart Snacks. </h4>
						<p>If you're snacking on not-so-healthy things like chips, pretzels, cakes, cookies or ice cream, 
							substitute them with tasty, smart snacks, such as: fruits and almonds, low-fat, high-protein 
							yogurt, low-fat cheese with crackers, veggies with low-fat dressing, or whole-grain bread with 
							peanut butter. To stay on track, ask yourself, "What tastes better than the next size down?"</p>

						<h4>Tip of the Day | Brown Bag It.</h4>
						<p>Skipping a meal is probably one of the worst things you can do. So don't let work get in the 
							way of eating lunch. Instead, take charge and bring your lunch to work! If you bring it, you'll
							probably eat it. Don't rely on the local deli or fast food joint for a quick fix, because the guy or 
							gal behind the counter could care less about what your size goal is. Remember, you're a 
							product of your choices. As an added bonus: bringing lunch can also be easier on your wallet.</p>

						<h4>Tip of the Day | Walk Daily for 30 Minutes. <span class="asterisk">*</span></h4>
						<p>Walking is probably one of the most effective forms of calorie burning because you are moving
							your entire body. And, it's simple to do. The goal here is NOT intensity, but duration. In fact, 
							you can burn fat more efficiently if you walk at a moderate pace for 30 minutes rather than running
							for 15. Faster isn't better, because when your heart rate gets too high it can put your body out of
							fat burning range.</p>

						<h4>Tip of the Day | Move! <span class="asterisk">*</span></h4>
						<p>Busy schedules often get in the way of our much-needed exercise. Here's how to get moving.
							1) Choose an activity that you ENJOY and feel competent doing. And, simply begin. Aim to do
							the activity 3 to 4 times a week for 20 minutes and just watch what happens. It's really that simple. 
							And remember, it's not a race. 2) Schedule exercise like any other appointment. Research shows 
							that if you treat this like an appointment, then you're less likely to cancel. 3) Find a partner. Not
							only will this bring more motivation to the task, but you will be less likely to be a "no show."</p>
